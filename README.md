# Aetous-Open-Decorations
A big library of all the decorations Aetous has made for their VR social game projects. Setup to use 

# How to Use
Clone or download the repo and save it somewhere safe.
Open Blender (v3 or higher reccommended) and go to `Edit > Preferences > File Paths`.
At the bottom of the page there is a section where you can add and manage asset libraries, add a new entry and direct it too the root of the repo.
Go back to the main blender UI, and from there you can add a new pane and switch it to the `Asset Browser` editor panel.
Select the asset library you added previously from the dropdown and you should now have access to all the models in the libary!

 **Note:** I am not a lawyer, and this does not constitute legal advice.

 I want people to be free to use the project however they like, even for profit. All I ask is that you inform your users about this project's existance so that they too can use it.

 If you incorporate it in a larger work, you are not forced to license the whole entire larger work as the same license. Simply referencing the project in the credits and, if possible, leaving a link to this project in the file structure is good enough. (If I've messed up the license please [email](Aetous@proton.me) me.)

If there is enough support I might release the models in this library under a more permissive license.

# Works Used
Many if not all of the textures used in this pack of models are not my own. If you use my work please consider supporting them, because without them my work would not be possible.
